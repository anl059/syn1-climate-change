## What is Climate Change?
Climate change refers to a long-term alteration of the Earth's climate, which is primarily caused by human activities such as the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation. It is a phenomenon that is characterized by changes in temperature, precipitation patterns, sea level rise, and extreme weather events such as hurricanes, droughts, and floods.

Climate change is caused by the buildup of greenhouse gases (primarily carbon dioxide) in the atmosphere, which trap heat from the sun and prevent it from escaping back into space. This causes the Earth's temperature to rise, leading to a range of impacts such as melting glaciers, sea level rise, ocean acidification, and more frequent and severe heatwaves, storms, and wildfires.

Climate change is a global issue that affects every living organism on Earth, and it requires collective action from governments, businesses, and individuals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and limit its impacts.
