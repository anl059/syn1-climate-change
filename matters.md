## Why Does Climate Change Matter?
1) **Environmental concerns:** Climate change causes harm to the environment, including loss of biodiversity, damage to ecosystems, and the extinction of plant and animal species.

2) **Human health:** Climate change increases the spread of infectious diseases, increase air pollution, and causes more frequent and severe heatwaves.

3) **Economic impacts:** Climate change disrupts supply chains which leads to changes in consumer behavior that can impact businesses and industries.

4) **Social justice concerns:** Climate change disproportionately affects marginalized communities and low-income populations, who often have fewer resources to adapt to its impacts.

5) **Global stability:** Climate change can intensify social and political instability by causing displacement of populations and creating conflicts over resources.

6) **Moral responsibility:** Bounded by a social contract, we have a moral responsibility to take action to address climate change and protect future generations from its impacts.
