## What are the Consequences of Climate Change?
1) **Rising sea levels:** Increasing temperature results in the melting of glaciers and ice sheets, which then causes sea levels to rise, resulting in the flooding and erosion of coastal areas which displaces millions of people.

2) **More frequent and severe weather events:** Climate change can cause extreme weather events such as heatwaves, droughts, hurricanes, and floods to occur more frequently and with greater intensity.

3) **Ocean acidification:** As carbon dioxide dissolves in the oceans, it lowers the pH of seawater, making it more acidic. This impacts marine ecosystems, an example being a decrease in the ability of shellfish and corals to build their protective structures.

4) **Changes in ecosystems:** Climate change can alter the distribution and behavior of species, which disrupts ecosystems and potentially causes extinction of some species.

5) **Food and water insecurity:** Changing temperature and rainfall patterns causes crop yields and freshwater availability to change, which results in food and water insecurity for millions of people.

6) **Public health impacts:** Rising temperatures and more frequent heatwaves can lead to heat-related illnesses. Climate change can also increase the spread of infectious diseases and air pollution, worsening people's respiratory and cardiovascular issues.

7) **Economic impacts:** Repairing damage from extreme weather events and investing in protective measures can come at a hefty cost.
