## Ways you can get Involved:
1) **Reduce energy consumption:** Conserving energy in your home and workplace by turning off lights and electronics when not in use, using energy-efficient appliances, and lowering your thermostat can reduce your carbon footprint.

2) **Use sustainable transportation:** Walking, biking, or using public transportation instead of driving alone can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

3) **Reduce waste:** Recycling, composting, and reducing your use of single-use plastics can help reduce the amount of waste that ends up in landfills.

4) **Conserve water:** Conserving water by fixing leaks, using low-flow fixtures, and reducing water usage can help reduce the amount of energy used to transport and treat water.

5) **Support renewable energy:** Supporting the development and use of renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydroelectric power can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

6) **Eat a plant-based diet:** Reducing meat consumption and adopting a plant-based diet can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with animal agriculture.

7) **Advocate for policy change:** Contacting elected officials and supporting policies that address climate change, such as carbon pricing and renewable energy standards, can help create systemic change towards a more sustainable future.
